# Blockchain Collector

**Blockchain Collector** is a Go package that collects data from a blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) and stores it in a PostgreSQL database efficiently. It leverages concurrency for parallel data processing and batching for optimized database writes.

---

## Features

- Fetches data from blockchain nodes using the [go-ethereum](https://geth.ethereum.org/) library.
- Stores block data into a PostgreSQL database.
- Utilizes goroutines for concurrent data collection.
- Configurable batch size and block ranges for flexibility.
- Graceful error handling and logging for robust performance.

---

## Requirements

- **Go**: Version 1.19 or higher.
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 12 or higher.
- **Blockchain Node**: An Ethereum node (e.g., [Infura](https://infura.io/) or a local node).

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or integrate the package into your Go project:
   ```bash
   go get github.com/yourusername/blockchain_collector
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

---

## Database Setup

Create the database schema before running the application:

```sql
CREATE TABLE blocks (
    number BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp BIGINT NOT NULL
);
```

---

## Usage

### Initialize the Collector

Hereâ€™s a sample implementation:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/yourusername/blockchain_collector"
)

func main() {
	const (
		rpcURL    = "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"
		dbURL     = "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/blockchain"
		batchSize = 10
		blockRange = 1000
		startBlock = 17000000
		endBlock   = 17001000
	)

	collector, err := blockchain_collector.NewCollector(rpcURL, dbURL, batchSize, blockRange)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to initialize collector: %v\n", err)
	}
	defer collector.Close()

	if err := collector.CollectData(startBlock, endBlock); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Data collection failed: %v\n", err)
	}
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **`rpcURL`**: The Ethereum node RPC endpoint.
- **`dbURL`**: PostgreSQL connection string.
- **`batchSize`**: Number of goroutines for parallel processing.
- **`blockRange`**: Maximum number of blocks to queue at a time.
- **`startBlock`** and **`endBlock`**: Define the range of blocks to fetch.

---

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Connects to the Ethereum node and PostgreSQL database.

2. **Concurrency**:
   - Launches multiple goroutines to fetch and process blocks concurrently.

3. **Block Processing**:
   - Retrieves block details (e.g., block number, hash, timestamp) and stores them in the database.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Logs errors during block processing and continues with the next blocks.

---

## Example Database Entry

After running the collector, the `blocks` table will contain data similar to:

| Number      | Hash                                   | Timestamp  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|------------|
| 17000000    | `0x1234abcd...`                       | 1672531200 |
| 17000001    | `0x5678efgh...`                       | 1672531260 |

---

## Extending the Package

The `processBlock` method can be customized to:
- Store transaction details.
- Log smart contract events.
- Analyze gas fees, miner rewards, etc.

Example:
```go
// Extend to fetch transaction data
transactions := block.Transactions()
for _, tx := range transactions {
    // Process and store transaction details
}
```

## Development

### Running Tests
To run tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

### Linting
Ensure the code adheres to Go standards:
```bash
golangci-lint run
```
